# Problem Statement

Luggage Bags Cost Prediction

 The dataset attached contains the data of 160 different bags associated with ABC industries. The bags have certain attributes which are described below:

Height – The height of the bag
Width – The width of the bag
Length – The length of the bag
Weight – The weight the bag can carry
Weight1 – Weight the bag can carry after expansion
 

The company now wants to predict the cost they should set for a new variant of these kinds of bags based on the attributes below. As a result, they want you to build a prediction model that can correctly set the cost of the bag provided the attributes are given. The task involves the following things:

Analyze the dataset and do EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) – 4 Marks
Plotting of various graphs & correlations – 4 Marks
Model Building using Multiple Linear Regression – 12 Marks [3 Marks for each SGD, Mini Batch, Gradient Descent, Normal SK-Learn library]
Calculating the R squared, RMSE, and MSE for the model - 4 Marks
 

Dataset: Data_miniproject.csv

 

Hints: EDA refers to exploring the dataset from various facets such as outliers, correlations, wrong data types, Null values, etc.

I am also attaching the links of SGD, MBGD, and Gradient Descent code links. You can refer to them while writing your code.

Additional Instructions:

Data need not be uploaded with the submission.
Submit the updated Jupyter Notebook with outputs + the final .ipynb notebook file converted as PDF, with proper formatting and alignment.
Incomplete output, misalignment, or lack of comments may result in mark deductions.
